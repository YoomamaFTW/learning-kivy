# Kivy - Python Discord Code Jam 6 Qualifier

The is my preparation for Python Discord's annual code jam. They partnered with Kivy this time around, and my only steps towards frontend development is increasing rapidly... I can't take it anymore. Not sure why I signed up (I believe it was due to being bored writing papers and I had 3 hours to spare as a break...).

Anyhow, the directories are self explanatory. They contain my notes and yada yada.
